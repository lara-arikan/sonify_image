# visuzalize_score
Converts pathways for scores in the MIT Music21 corpus into strips of color. Each pitch in the score is scaled and translated into a visible light frequency, creating a multicolored band.

All possible scores in the corpus are here: https://web.mit.edu/music21/doc/about/referenceCorpus.html
Sample outputs are given in the repository for BWV 108 and Chopin's Mazurka Op. 6 No. 2.
